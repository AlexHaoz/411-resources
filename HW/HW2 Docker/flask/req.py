# Project Description
# This project will develop GiggleGit, a version control system where merges are managed by memes, created by CodeChuckle. The goal is to provide a fun and intuitive merging experience using meme-based suggestions, while ensuring compatibility with Git. A major focus is on creating a smooth onboarding experience for new users.

# Agile Development
# Theme:
# Get GiggleGit demo into a stable alpha to start onboarding some adventurous clients.

# Epic:
# Onboarding experience

# User Story 1:
# As a vanilla Git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to understand how meme-based merging works right away, so that I can get started without having to learn too many new things.

# Task: Provide an interactive onboarding guide for new users.
# Ticket 1: Create an onboarding tutorial for GiggleGit.
# Develop an interactive step-by-step tutorial that simulates key Git operations with memes, including merging, branching, and pull requests.
# Ticket 2: Implement an onboarding progress tracker.
# Allow users to track their progress through the tutorial and revisit completed sections if needed.
# User Story 2:
# As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to be able to set up my team with appropriate permissions and workflows so that they can collaborate efficiently.

# Task: Implement a team management system with user roles.
# Ticket 1: Develop an admin dashboard for team leads.
# Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) where team leads can manage user access, project settings, and team workflows.
# Ticket 2: Design a role-based access control (RBAC) system.
# Allow team leads to create roles (e.g., contributor, reviewer, admin) with specific permissions.
# User Story 3:
# As a developer working on a project using GiggleGit, I want to be able to undo/revert merges that went wrong so that I can recover from mistakes.

# Task: Implement a merge rollback feature.
# Ticket 1: Maintain a history log of all merges.
# Store metadata about each merge, including commit history, conflicts, and user actions.
# Ticket 2: Create an "Undo Merge" button for recent merges.
# Allow users to easily revert the last merge operation if needed.
# Point/Question 3:
# This is not a user story. Why not?
# "As a user, I want to be able to authenticate on a new machine."

# Response:
# This is not a valid user story because it does not specify the why (the benefit or motivation for the user). A better user story would be:
# "As a developer who uses multiple devices, I want to authenticate on a new machine so that I can continue working seamlessly across different environments."

# Formal Requirements for SnickerSync
# SnickerSync is a new diff tool for GiggleGit that enhances version control with meme-based diffing and merging suggestions.

# Goal:
# Ensure SnickerSync improves user experience by providing a reliable and efficient diff tool that aligns with GiggleGit's meme-based version control.

# Non-Goal:
# SnickerSync is not designed to be used on mobile devices.

# Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
# 1. Team permissions and accessibility settings
# Functional Requirement 1: Enable team leads and admins to set different permission levels for contributors, reviewers, and PMs.
# Functional Requirement 2: Implement authentication and access controls to restrict access based on user roles.
# 2. User study and testing capabilities
# Functional Requirement 3: Implement an A/B testing system where users are randomly assigned to control or variant groups to compare different SnickerSync versions.
# Functional Requirement 4: Integrate analytics tracking to monitor user engagement, actions, and interactions across different SnickerSync variations.
